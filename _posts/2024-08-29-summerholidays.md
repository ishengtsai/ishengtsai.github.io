This summer the lab welcomed two summer interns Yo-C and En-Chen. We also welcomed Audrey, a new PhD student who is joining the TIGP Biodiversity program. It's always difficult for lab to choose an outing place, but this time we managed to find a good activity - khòng-iô (焢窯) near Yangmingshan National Park.
